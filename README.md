A questionaire project assigned to us by Life-Choices Academy

Goodday and welcome viewer.

I have here in front of you produced a Quiz challenge of immense proportion.
Because I just love customer service and providing a good experience,
I have not only just made one quiz, but three different one's.

The three quiz options will be namely the following:
*Playstation
*Xbox
*PC

Each quiz consists out of twenty questions each and you are required to answer
atleast one of three quizes to find out if you have the right to belong to
the 'Gamer' world.

You would need to get atleast for my own personal preference 13/20 to call yourself a 'Gamer'.

Instructions:
*Clone or copy the contents of this main file to your desktop
*Download Wampserver
*Install Wampserver
*Double-click on Wampserver.exe once it has finnished installing
*Wampserver will then run a command line establishing a secure server on your
personal computer so that you are able to see the results of the Php
*At the bottom right of your screen, click on the hide arrow icon(usually showing up)
*Left-click on wampserver logo
*Click on Localhost
*This will now bring you to the local webhost of wampserver
*Scroll down and at the bottom left you will see "Add a virtual host", click on it
*In the name field box provided type 'Gaming-Quiz'
*Complete absolute path of the VirtualHost folder Examples: C:/wamp/www/projet/ or E:/www/site1/
(Where the main folder is located)
*Click on 'Start the creation of the Virtualhost'
*Now a local server has started and it is displaying the content of the quiz
*Click on 'Back to homepage' at the top of the screen
*Scroll down and at the bottom right hand corner under 'Your VirtualHost' you will see 'Gaming-Quiz'
*Click on the link and choose your quiz

Rules of the Game-Quiz:
*No scratching
*No biting
*No lalagaging
*No looking to the web for answers
*If you get less than 20 for the class, you are wrong
*Have fun
*Pass this along to friends and test their knowledge
